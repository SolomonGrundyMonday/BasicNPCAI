In this OpenGL project, I plan to implement a basic "chasing" NPC AI for further iteration and if the project is successful, I
may import it to a future project.  For now, the concept is to create a simple virtual environment in OpenGL
2.0 with various obstacles and implement a simple MDP-based AI to chase the player around the map.  The idea is to expand my
programming portfolio and add more options to my toolkit for future projects.  
TO-DO list:
-  Design virtual environment
-  Break environment into discrete sections for MDP reward functions
-  Implement player movement and update the current game state based on player movement.
-  Implement AI to chase player while avoiding environmental objects.
-  Iterate as needed.

Everything in this README is subject to change, and will be updated periodically as the project is built.
